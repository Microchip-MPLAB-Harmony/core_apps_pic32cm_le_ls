# FAT filesystem using NVM Media

This application shows an example of implementing a FAT disk in the device internal Flash memory.

## Description

### File System Operations on NVM:

- Application places a FAT disk image consisting of a Master Boot Record (MBR) sector, Logical Boot Sector, File allocation Table, and Root Directory Area in the internal Flash memory (NVM)

- During execution, the application first opens an existing file named **FILE.TXT** and performs following file system related operations:
    - **SYS_FS_FileStat**
    - **SYS_FS_FileSize**
    - **SYS_FS_FileSeek**
    - **SYS_FS_FileEOF**

- It tries to read the file and checks if string **"Data"** is present. If present it continues to next step or it fails the application

- Finally, the string **"Hello World"** is written to this file. The string is then read and compared with the string that was written to the file. If the string compare is successful, An LED indication is provided

### File system layer uses:

- Memory driver to communicate with underlying NVM media
